# This was the last homework assigned in CS 1331, titled "Jordle" (Wordle using JavaFX)
# In addition to the normal functionality of Wordle, we were required to have an instructions button, which displayed
# the instructions of how to play, and a restart button which cleared all guesses and generated a new word.
# The additional features that I added were a light and dark mode, as well as a statistics window that shows data about the
# word the user was guessing.
