1. A Dark Mode/Light Mode button that changes the background, the title, the grid background, and the grid text to match
the mode it is in. The button itself also changes text so when the screen is in light mode it reads "Dark Mode" and when
the screen is in dark mode it reads "Light Mode".
2. An end screen that gives the user the option to open a statistics window that displays the statistics corresponding to
the target word, including the percentage of the time the target word was guessed correctly and the average number of
guesses it took to obtain that target word. The statistics are stored in a text file (stats.txt) so past runs of the game
are included in the statistics.
